# CountDown Timer

This project was a great exercise to follow and to understand how things work:
- tried creating a small personal bio page
- understood how to write HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- learned how to link each document and how to use them specifically

### Updates?
There probably will be major changes for this project. As I learn new things and get more confortable with writing my own code, I'll definitely change thinks around make my page more attractive.
