<h2 align="center">CountDown Timer</h2>

This project was a great exercise to follow and to understand how things work:
- tried creating a countdown using JavaScript
- understood how to update HTML elements with JavaScript content

<h1>Updates?</h1>
There probably will be minor changes for this project, like changing the background image, or updating links. As I learn new things and get more confortable with writing my own code, I'll definitely change thinks around.
